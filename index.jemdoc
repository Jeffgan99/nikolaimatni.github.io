== Research Overview
Machine learning techniques - bolstered by successes in video games, sophisticated robotic simulations, and Go â€“ are now being applied to plan and
control the behavior of autonomous systems interacting with physical environments. Such systems, which include self-driving vehicles, distributed sensor
networks, and agile robots, must interact with complex environments that
are ever changing and difficult to model, strongly motivating the use of data-driven decision making and control. However, if machine learning techniques
are to be applied in these new settings, it is critical that they be accompanied
by guarantees of reliability, robustness, and safety, as failures could be catastrophic. To address these challenges, my research is focused on developing learning-based control strategies for the design of safe and robust autonomous networked systems. Please see my publications page for current research projects, and the talks below for an accessible introduction (aimed at a general engineering audience) to some of the ideas behind my work.  The first talk (given as part of the Everhart Lecture Series at Caltech) focusses on more control theoretic ideas, whereas the second (given as part of the SILO seminar series at UW-Madison) presents a high-level overview of my approach to integrating machine learning into safety critical control loops.
